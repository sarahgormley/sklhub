This project is to build an application encouraging the users to revert to the old way of doing things.  Before money was introduced, people traded their skills and talents through a bartering system.  In this way, everyone got what they want or meet their needs, coming up with fair trades and putting their education and professional abilities to good use.

Our application will facilitate money-free bartering system if possible or little money is needed, making it simple or find services they need and to offer their skills and talents to others.  At the same time, to foster friendships in the neighbourhood.  Whatever need you have, we aim to fill it with this application and the target will be the new college graduates, established professionals, entrepreneurs, tradesperson and people from all walks of life.

This application will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authenication.

## Installation

* This application follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm.  The Model-View-Controller(MVC) is an architectural pattern that adheres to the separation of concerns principle. 

   - The Model - stores data and data-related logic,
   - The View - the UI/UX concerns, or what a user will see and interact,
   - The Controller - the interface between Models and Views.  It processes the requests from the View, uses the Model to manipulate data and sends data to the View to render.

* This application will need the installation of Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the template engine and use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM as the database.

* Node Package Manager (npm) is a software manager and installer which puts the modules in place so that node project can utilize it, and also, it manages dependency conflicts intelligently.

* The npm packages in use for this project:-

  - NPM Express.js (npm i express)
  - NPM Handlebars.js (npm i handlebars)
  - NPM Sequelize ORM (npm i sequelize)
  - NPM Express-Session (npm i express-session)
  - NPM bcrypt (npm i bcrypt)
  - NPM mysql2 (npm install --save mysql2)
  - NPM dotenv (npm install dotenv --save)
  - NPM nodemon (npm i -D nodemon)
  - NPM connect-session-sequelize (npm i connect-session-sequelize)
  - NPM Cookies (npm i cookies)
  - NPM Router (npm i router)

 * Nodemon is installed as development dependency meaning that if our application ever goes into production, this package will not be included. The purpose of this package is to watch for any changes in our files and restart the server instead of us having to do that manually ourselves. 

* The database models are set up in accordance to the criteria for this application.  See the screenshots from MySQL WorkBench.
