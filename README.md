## Group Project 2 : SKLHub

This project is to build an application encouraging the users to revert to the old way of doing things.  Before money was introduced, people traded their skills and talents through a bartering system.  In this way, everyone got what they want or meet their needs, coming up with fair trades and putting their education and professional abilities to good use.

Our application will facilitate money-free bartering system if possible or little money is needed.
making it simple or find services they need and to offer their skills and talents to others.  At the same time, to foster friendships in the neighbourhood.  Whatever need you have, we aim to fill it with this application and the target will be the new college graduates, established professionals, entrepreneurs, and tradesperson.
